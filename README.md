# vim-dotfiles
vim dotfiles targeted for Ruby on Rails development

This project started from the https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles project, although I've found it overwhelming and started trimming the unused stuff.

I've been used this with Linux (Fedora) and with Bash shell.

If you have any comment or suggestion please contact me.

# Instructions

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:fidalgo/vim-dotfiles.git
```

and then run the installer (change it if you need)
```sh
./install.sh
```
