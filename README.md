# dotfiles
dottfiles targeted for Ruby on Rails development.

I've been used this with Linux (Fedora) and with Bash shell.

If you have any comment or suggestion please contact me.

# Instructions

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:fidalgo/dotfiles.git
```

and then run the installer (change it if you need)

```sh
ruby setup.rb --install
```

This has been tested with Ruby 3.X, but it uses common API so it should work with some previous versions as well.
